# Replicon

Obsidian is great, but I wanted a different set of icons for the interface. Instead of trying to petition the developers, I decided to try to do it myself.

This is a WIP, and will be under on-and-off development. Don't expect anything in here to work until I do a 1.0.0 release.

## Get to work

- Clone this repo.
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`
    - This will compile everything properly, and will also automatically copy over your files to your open vaults under `$VAULT/.obsidian/plugins/replicon/`. Copied filed as this time are `main.js`, `styles.css`, and `manifest.json`.
